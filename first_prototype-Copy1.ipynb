NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Though Schaaf wouldn't disclose the reason she dismissed Ben Fairow less than a week after tapping him as interim chief, she called her decision to hire him a \"mistake\" and said she had learned Monday information that \"caused me to lose confidence in Ben Fairow's ability to lead the Oakland Police Department at this particular moment.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Fairow, who began his career 26 years ago at OPD, was on loan from BART police, where he served as a deputy chief. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Ben Fairow addresses the media as he is named interim Oakland police chief at City Hall in Oakland, Calif., on Friday, June 10, 2016. On Wednesday Fairow was forced out. (Dan Honda/Bay Area News Group) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement late Wednesday, BART police Chief Kenton Rainey disclosed that, while married, Fairow had \"a personal relationship with a consenting adult more than a decade ago, none of which precludes him from serving as a sworn law enforcement officer or as one of my deputy chiefs.\" Rainey said he would welcome Fairow back to the BART force. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Multiple sources told Bay Area News Group that Fairow apparently had inappropriate sexual contact with another employee during his earlier stint with OPD, possibly influencing Schaaf's decision. However, BART spokesman Jim Allison said the relationship referred to in Rainey's statement did not involve an OPD worker. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"I own the mistake I made. The important thing is that I'm fixing it, and I'm fixing it quickly,\" Schaaf said at a Wednesday news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Paul Figueroa, who has served as the department's inspector general and oversaw training before becoming assistant chief under Whent, was named acting chief. Schaaf said an interim chief from outside the department will be hired as the city searches nationally for a permanent chief. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Schaaf cited state law protecting personnel information in refusing to discuss what led to Fairow's firing. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday's announcement was the latest in a string of developments to rock the police department in recent weeks, all stemming from the growing sexual misconduct scandal involving multiple officers. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Fairow was named the interim chief late Thursday evening following Chief Sean Whent's departure, which sources say was orchestrated by the department's federal monitor, upset over the misconduct case involving officers from Oakland police and other East Bay agencies and a teen girl. Five Oakland officers have resigned or been placed on administrative leave in the fallout, along with a Contra Costa County sheriff's deputy, with at least four officers alleged to have had sex with the girl while she was under age. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR And in a development late Wednesday, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley issued a statement that a DA inspector has been placed on administrative leave in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR O'Malley, who has focused her tenure in office on human trafficking, declined to name the inspector. However, the woman at the center of the sex scandal, Celeste Guap, claims to have had an online friendship when she was under age with DA inspector Rick Orozco, who at the time was an OPD captain. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR According to a message provided by Guap, Orozco purportedly once wrote: \"I would love your taco!\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mayor Schaaf has repeatedly said that in the investigation into officer wrongdoing prompted by this scandal, no former Oakland officers in the District Attorney's Office would participate. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"The alleged conduct of the officers in this matter is not in line with what our office and the wider community feel is acceptable for those who are sworn to protect and serve,\" O'Malley's statement Wednesday said in part. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR During his previous stint at OPD, Fairow earned the nickname \"Straight Arrow\" Fairow, for following procedure by the book. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A deputy chief at BART since 2011, Fairow was named in a lawsuit by the widow of Sgt. Tom Smith, accidentally killed by detective Michael Maes in a friendly fire shooting while serving a search warrant in 2014.

Fairow—who replaced resigning police chief Sean Whent on Friday amid an investigation into possible underage sex and murder—was removed from his post Wednesday after just six days, reports the Los Angeles Times. During a background check, Mayor Libby Schaaf says she received information that \"raised concerns for me about whether [Fairow] can effectively lead this department at this particular moment in time.\" She didn't elaborate, but the chief of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department—where Fairow previously served and will return—says Fairow told him he had an affair with a consenting adult while married more than a decade ago, per the AP. Fairow worked for the Oakland Police Department at that time. Sources tell the East Bay Times that the other party was an employee, though a BART rep denies that. While an officer's suicide note first suggested that four Oakland officers were involved with an underage prostitute, the woman now claims she had sexual contact with some two dozen officers from various agencies in exchange for protection or knowledge of prostitution stings in the works, including while she was underage; she is now 18. A Contra Costa County Sheriff's deputy has been suspended, two Oakland officers have resigned, and three are on administrative leave. \"We are dealing with disgusting allegations that upset me greatly,\" says Schaaf. \"I believe that the leadership at this time is critical in order to build confidence that the culture of this department does not tolerate unethical behavior, sexual misconduct, or lying.\" Assistant Police Chief Paul Figueroa has been appointed acting chief while the department searches for a permanent replacement.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Claims that US diplomats suffered mysterious brain injuries after being targeted with a secret weapon in Cuba have been challenged by neurologists and other brain specialists. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A medical report commissioned by the US government, published in March, found that staff at the US embassy in Havana suffered concussion-like brain damage after hearing strange noises in homes and hotels, but doctors from the US, the UK and Germany have contested the conclusions. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In four separate letters to the Journal of the American Medical Association, which published the original medical study, groups of doctors specialising in neurology, neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology described what they believed were major flaws in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Cuba says 'undefined sounds' at home left US embassy official feeling ill Read more NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Among the criticisms, published on Tuesday, are that the University of Pennsylvania team which assessed the diplomats misinterpreted test results, overlooked common disorders that might have made the workers feel sick, or dismissed psychological explanations for their symptoms. Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania defended their report in a formal response in the journal, but the specialists told the Guardian they stood by their criticisms. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The US withdrew more than half of its Havana diplomats last year and expelled 15 Cubans after 24 embassy staff and family reported a bizarre list of symptoms, ranging from headaches, dizziness and difficulties in sleeping, to problems with concentration, balance, vision and hearing. Many said their symptoms developed after they heard strange noises, described as cicada-like chirps, grinding, or the buffeting caused by an open window in the car. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The accounts led Washington to claim the diplomats had been victims of “acoustic attacks”, though an FBI investigation found no evidence that sonic weapons were involved. Physicists have voiced doubts that such weapons were even feasible. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR At the request of the US government, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania ran checks on 21 diplomats and investigated six with a further 37 tests. Led by Doug Smith, the director of the university’s centre for brain injury, the team concluded that the patients had concussion-like injuries caused by damage to “widespread brain networks”. The state department now cites the medical report on its travel advice pages and urges people to reconsider visiting Cuba. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The doctors who contacted the journal disagreed with the diagnosis. Robert Shura, a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist at Salisbury veterans affairs medical centre in North Carolina, and two colleagues, said Smith’s team had misinterpreted cognitive tests performed on the diplomats. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Doctors said Smith’s team too easily dismissed functional neurological disorders such as “acoustic shock”, which affects telephone operators who hear sudden loud noises in their headsets. Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It is standard practice to compare people’s scores on such tests with others in the population. A score in the bottom 5% would typically mean there is a problem. But Shura pointed out that the diplomats were found to be “impaired” if they scored in the bottom 40% in any one of the tests.

       "      <td>– Something made a slew of American diplomats in Cuba sick last year, and scientists still aren't sure what it was. A major study commissioned by the US government found that diplomats suffered concussion-like symptoms, and many of them reported hearing strange noises before falling ill. Now, however, four separate letters by scientists in the US and several other nations are challenging that initial study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, reports the Guardian. The critics, writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, say the Penn researchers misinterpreted results and too easily dismissed causes such as a \"mass psychogenic illness.\" The Penn researchers, meanwhile, are standing by their work and say additional research continues. Highlights: Psychological? Robert Bartholomew, a US scientist who works in New Zealand, makes the case for a \"mass psychogenic illness,\" also known as mass hysteria, reports BuzzFeed. The Cuban illnesses have all the hallmarks, he says, and he faults the Penn researchers for not investigating how closely the victims knew each other, and perhaps fed off each other in terms of symptoms. Inner ear: Another critic faults the first study for not focusing more on potential inner ear trouble. \"Almost all of the patients complained of hearing loss and balance problems,\" writes Gerard Gianoli of Louisana's Ear and Balance Institute. “I do wish they would be more thoroughly evaluated.” Cognitive results: The Penn researchers found that some victims suffered cognitive damage, but another researcher thinks they're wrong. The Penn scientists considered subjects \"impaired\" if they scored in the bottom 40% of tests; the more accepted benchmark would be closer to 5%.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Over the past year, Michael Flynn sat down with federal investigators 19 times, answering questions and providing evidence. On Tuesday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller shared just a small amount of what he told them in a legal filing that should spook the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A year and three days since President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, Mueller filed two brief legal documents calling for him to spend no time in prison over it. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In the filings, Mueller, a decorated Marine veteran, pointedly noted that Flynn — unlike “every other person who has been charged” in the special counsel investigation — had a long record of military and public service, which made his initial lies to the government all the more confounding. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But the tone of the filing was much different from Mueller’s filings on former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who reported to a federal prison camp last week, and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, who Mueller said breached a cooperation agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR After a daylong buildup of anticipation to the filing of the Flynn sentencing document, it turned out to say little that wasn’t already known. In January of 2017, Flynn lied to the FBI about a conversation he had with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak just a month earlier, falsely telling investigators that he hadn’t discussed sanctions with him. That conversation took place the day the Obama Administration announced it was imposing sanctions on Russia for attempting to interfere in the election, raising questions about whether he violated the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments about official disputes. He also lied about discussing a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements with Kislyak. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Two months later, Flynn failed to fully disclose the nature of his work in Turkey when registering with the government as a foreign agent, omitting the fact that he had worked on a project at the direction of the Turkish government while advising the Trump campaign on national security issues. Additionally, he failed to disclose that he authored an op-ed on behalf of the Turkish government about the attempted coup, falsely stating he wrote it of his own volition. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Flynn had revealed during his court appearance last year that he was cooperating with the Special Counsel’s office, but the filings reveal both the extent and the implications for the probe as a whole. Mueller noted that Flynn later worked extensively with the special counsel’s investigation, likely prompting other witnesses to be more forthcoming. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation,” Mueller wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But several parts of the addendum were blacked out in the publicly available version, including a section describing a criminal investigation, a second investigation that is entirely redacted, a portion describing interactions between the Trump transition team and Russia and a brief description of one way that Flynn cooperated. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Some of Trump’s allies were quick to declare victory for the President. “Everyone’s going to focus on what has been redacted,” Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News. “But let’s look at what’s not in there. There is no suggestion that Michael Flynn had anything to do with collusion. He was with the transition team, he was part of the campaign, and yet there’s no mention of collusion. I think it’s good news for President Trump tonight that this is what it’s come down to.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But Democrats, as well as some legal experts, disagreed. While this filing doesn’t spell out the President’s legal vulnerabilities, they argue, it provides a glimpse of the wealth of information he has accumulated about the Trump campaign’s conduct. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “What this suggests is there is one more major ball to drop and we don’t know what that is,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Adam Schiff, the likely incoming chair of the House Select Permanent Committee on Intelligence — who could, if he wanted to, reopen that investigation into Russian interference when Democrats take control in the next Congress — offered similar sentiments regarding Mueller’s fact-finding.

Indeed, in addition to providing information on \"interactions between individuals in the presidential transition team and Russia,\" and claiming such individuals directed him to discuss sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the US, Trump's former national security adviser cooperated in a criminal investigation separate from the Russia probe, the filing states, per USA Today. Rep. Mark Meadows says \"no mention of collusion\" is \"good news for President Trump,\" per Time, though a former federal prosecutor tells CNN he believes \"Flynn provided information that is allowing Mueller to make a criminal case against someone.\" Mueller notes Flynn's decision to cooperate, which likely encouraged other witnesses to follow suit, \"was particularly valuable because he was one of the first people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation.\" These words differ greatly from those Mueller has used to describe Paul Manafort, suggesting \"full disclosure will be rewarded while attempts to thwart him … will be severely punished,\" CNN reports, mentioning \"Trump's Twitter praise for associates such as Roger Stone, who have refused to cooperate with Mueller\" and his criticisms of those who've agreed.

       "      <td>KIEV, Ukraine — In an effort to stabilize Ukraine and extend its authority, the interim government has set a deadline of Friday for turning in the illegal firearms that are now carried openly by so-called self-defense groups in Independence Square, the politically important plaza in the center of the capital. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The order was seconded on Thursday by the French ambassador to Ukraine, Alain Rémy, who said the disarmament of the militias that helped overthrow the former government is a central requirement for the European Union to begin disbursing financial aid, along with the government fighting corruption. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who was a staunch supporter of the protesters but never condoned violent tactics, set the deadline for Friday, the day Ukraine is scheduled to sign the political articles of an association agreement with the European Union. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “For those who want to defend their country with an assault rifle in their hands, welcome to the National Guard or the Army,” Mr. Yatsenyuk said in a speech this week. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the self-organized defense groups that formed to defend Independence Square and other protest sites during the uprising have been reluctant to comply. Like gun owners in countries like the United States and Switzerland where ownership of firearms is widespread, they contend that the weapons are needed to defend the country against a possible foreign invasion and to defend their freedoms from potential government abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s not normal to ask people to hand in their weapons in the situation we have now,” Dmytro Yarosh, the leader of a right-wing paramilitary group, Right Sector, said in an interview this week. His organization opposes the request to surrender its weapons, but will comply with the law, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Yarosh said lawyers with his group were drafting a bill for consideration in Parliament that was modeled on Swiss notions of firearms possession, in which an armed population is seen as a quick deterrent against a foreign invasion. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “Allow people to keep weapons at home,” Mr. Yarosh said, describing the logic of gun ownership in the context of Ukraine. “Then, when the enemy walks down the streets of your country, you can shoot him right from your own window.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Members of Right Sector have not just hunting rifles but also military weapons that were seized from an Interior Ministry arsenal in western Ukraine in the final days of the uprising. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The hunting weapons are legal, if the owner has a permit. In Ukraine, people 21 and older may apply for a license to own a shotgun for hunting, and those 25 and older may apply for a permit to own a rifle. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Pistols that fire nonlethal plastic or rubber bullets are also legal for citizens who can demonstrate a risk of assault because of their profession, which in Ukraine can include law enforcement officers for off-duty use, civil servants and journalists. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The self-defense units have been reluctant to describe in detail the seized military weapons, which were from an arsenal outside the city of Lviv. Mr. Yarosh said Right Sector helped move the weapons to the capital in late February. Today, he said of his supporters, “in part they handed in these weapons, in part they keep them.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The military weapons reached the capital too late to play a role in the street fighting, protest leaders have said. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Continue reading the main story Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the opposition street fighters who clashed with the police in Kiev in February carried only baseball bats and other improvised bludgeons, like lead pipes or table legs with nails driven through the ends. But analysts said it was the size of the crowds, rather than weaponry, that was the pivotal political factor. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The interim government is now seeking to integrate the loosely organized militias into a newly formed national guard, though several hard-line groups, including Right Sector, have declined to join. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR At the group’s headquarters in the Dnipro Hotel here, where men in jeans and military fatigues guarded the hallways this week, some of them with black-and-red bandannas over their faces, a man with a submachine gun stood guard outside the office of Mr. Yarosh.

It was one of the day's two auspicious signings; earlier, interim Ukrainian President Arseniy Yatsenyuk signed on to what Reuters refers to as a \"landmark\" political association agreement with the European Union. It was ousted president Viktor Yanukovich's opposition to the pact—in favor of closer ties to Russia—that started the protests that began the crisis. The deal calls for greater political and economic cooperation, and eventually free trade once a new president is elected in May. Yatsenyuk said the deal indicated that the EU would \"speak in one single and strong voice\" to support the Ukraine, CNN reports. As for that other signing? \"Frankly, I don't care about Russia signing\" the annexation bill, Yatsenyuk said. \"I care about Ukraine, Ukrainians, and our European future.\" In other Ukraine news: Ukraine set today as the deadline for the militias patrolling Independence Square in Kiev to turn in the illegal weapons that they openly carry, the New York Times reports. Europe is insisting the groups disarm before any financial aid flows to Ukraine. Ukrainian troops will today join NATO training exercises in Bulgaria, the AP reports. The exercises were planned before the crisis broke, but take on an extra significance now. Vladimir Putin laughed off US sanctions, RT reports. Referring to the targeted lawmakers he derisively said, \"Yes, these are those so-called 'polite people in camouflage with guns.' ... I need to avoid these citizens as they are 'compromising the country.'\" He also said that he'd open an account at the sanctioned Rossiya bank.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Dan Stevens (“Downton Abbey”), as the Beast, has the heaviest lift. He’s emoting through a CGI veil that never quite feels real. But his cranky character is more engaging this time around. He’s a fellow reader who doesn’t treat Belle with chivalrous kid gloves. In their snowball fight, he actually goes through with lobbing a gigantic one at her, knocking her to the ground. It’s a weirdly slapstick moment, but I liked it. When has a Disney princess ever been treated like the love interest in a Farrelly brothers movie? NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The castle’s animated inanimate objects — a candlestick (Ewan McGregor), clock (Ian McKellen), teapot (Emma Thompson), wardrobe (Audra McDonald) and feather duster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), plus Stanley Tucci as a piano — stump along pretty much like they did in the cartoon. McGregor’s rendition of “Be Our Guest” is a retro-styled showstopper, though I can’t say the same of the three new songs, which just increase the soundtrack’s clunkers-to-classics ratio. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR And about that gay subplot? Yup, it’s obvious LeFou (Josh Gad, every musical’s secret weapon) has a thing for his buddy — the tavern singalong “Gaston,” the film’s best number, all but spells it out. There’s a brief shot of two men dancing, and a scene in which one redneck villager, magicked into a dress and makeup, responds with delight instead of horror. It’s also worth noting that Ashman, who died of complications from AIDS in 1991, saw the cursed Beast as a metaphor for the disease. So if you loved the original, you’ve already embraced a gay subtext. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Other (light) modernist touches abound. The witch, who initially curses the prince, pops up throughout the film: “Do you know what happens to spinsters whose fathers die?” Gaston growls at Belle, gesturing at a beggar woman. She’ll later be the one who saves Belle’s dad. When Gaston fearmongers villagers into storming the Beast’s castle, it hums with a certain topicality; likewise the flock of books fighting back against an illiterate mob. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Really, everybody wins. If you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that’s what you’ll get. Those who always desired a little more depth from “Beauty and the Beast” will be happy, too: There’s something there that wasn’t there before. ||||| Video (01:59) : The fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In 1991, Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” became the first animated film nominated for the best picture Oscar. The studio’s live action and computer-graphic remake likely won’t have to worry about the Academy Awards. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Don’t misunderstand: It is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza. It musically honors its earlier version, providing greatest-hits cover versions of the classic songs by Alan Menken, plus four originals. It welcomes a new generation of viewers with the “Harry Potter” audience appeal of Emma Watson in the progressive, quasi-feminist leading role. In short, the movie, directed by Bill Condon (of “Chicago,” “Dreamgirls” and two “Twilight Saga” entries), is fine. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Beauty and the Beast ★★½ out of 4 stars Rating: PG, some action, violence, peril and frightening images. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But it’s also less magical than what the studio achieved with two-dimensional illustrations a quarter-century ago.

       "      <td>– Disney's original Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. In other words, its live-action remake starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens has a tough act to follow. According to critics, it's good—but doesn't quite measure up to the original. The general reaction: \"If you thought it was a bad idea to mess with a classic, Beauty and the Beast will persuade you that a tale as old as time is worth retelling,\" writes Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. While it's \"not quite as good as its predecessor,\" it's still \"a vastly entertaining film that combines old-school charm with technological wizardry,\" he adds, giving props to both Watson and Stevens. Colin Covert agrees this retelling is \"less magical\" than the 1991 original, \"an underperforming example of more being considerably less,\" he writes at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. But he also finds much to enjoy, from \"the subplot of egotistical Gaston\" to the impressive detail in the computer imagery. In short, \"it is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza.\" Sara Stewart actually thinks this new version is better than the original, partly because the Beast is \"more engaging.\" But the film as a whole \"has something for everyone,\" she writes at the New York Post. \"If you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that's what you'll get. Those who always desired a little more depth from Beauty and the Beast will be happy, too.\" One who was not happy: Joe Morgenstern. He argues the film \"betrays the essence of what made the 1991 animated feature a beloved classic\" through \"a succession of disjunctures, missed moments and dubious deviations from the earlier script.\" It feels \"crazily cluttered\" and Watson's Belle is bland to boot, he writes at the Wall Street Journal. He does, however, praise the \"huge jolts of visual energy.\" The film features Disney's first \"exclusively gay moment,\" even if the reference is subtle.\\n</td>\n",

       "710  OAKLAND -- The man tapped last week to lead the Oakland Police Department through a sexual-misconduct scandal was abruptly fired by Mayor Libby Schaaf on Wednesday, apparently after she became aware of an affair he had while working previously for the department. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Though Schaaf wouldn't disclose the reason she dismissed Ben Fairow less than a week after tapping him as interim chief, she called her decision to hire him a \"mistake\" and said she had learned Monday information that \"caused me to lose confidence in Ben Fairow's ability to lead the Oakland Police Department at this particular moment.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Fairow, who began his career 26 years ago at OPD, was on loan from BART police, where he served as a deputy chief. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Ben Fairow addresses the media as he is named interim Oakland police chief at City Hall in Oakland, Calif., on Friday, June 10, 2016. On Wednesday Fairow was forced out. (Dan Honda/Bay Area News Group) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement late Wednesday, BART police Chief Kenton Rainey disclosed that, while married, Fairow had \"a personal relationship with a consenting adult more than a decade ago, none of which precludes him from serving as a sworn law enforcement officer or as one of my deputy chiefs.\" Rainey said he would welcome Fairow back to the BART force. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Multiple sources told Bay Area News Group that Fairow apparently had inappropriate sexual contact with another employee during his earlier stint with OPD, possibly influencing Schaaf's decision. However, BART spokesman Jim Allison said the relationship referred to in Rainey's statement did not involve an OPD worker. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"I own the mistake I made. The important thing is that I'm fixing it, and I'm fixing it quickly,\" Schaaf said at a Wednesday news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Paul Figueroa, who has served as the department's inspector general and oversaw training before becoming assistant chief under Whent, was named acting chief. Schaaf said an interim chief from outside the department will be hired as the city searches nationally for a permanent chief. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Schaaf cited state law protecting personnel information in refusing to discuss what led to Fairow's firing. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday's announcement was the latest in a string of developments to rock the police department in recent weeks, all stemming from the growing sexual misconduct scandal involving multiple officers. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Fairow was named the interim chief late Thursday evening following Chief Sean Whent's departure, which sources say was orchestrated by the department's federal monitor, upset over the misconduct case involving officers from Oakland police and other East Bay agencies and a teen girl. Five Oakland officers have resigned or been placed on administrative leave in the fallout, along with a Contra Costa County sheriff's deputy, with at least four officers alleged to have had sex with the girl while she was under age. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR And in a development late Wednesday, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley issued a statement that a DA inspector has been placed on administrative leave in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR O'Malley, who has focused her tenure in office on human trafficking, declined to name the inspector. However, the woman at the center of the sex scandal, Celeste Guap, claims to have had an online friendship when she was under age with DA inspector Rick Orozco, who at the time was an OPD captain. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR According to a message provided by Guap, Orozco purportedly once wrote: \"I would love your taco!\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mayor Schaaf has repeatedly said that in the investigation into officer wrongdoing prompted by this scandal, no former Oakland officers in the District Attorney's Office would participate. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"The alleged conduct of the officers in this matter is not in line with what our office and the wider community feel is acceptable for those who are sworn to protect and serve,\" O'Malley's statement Wednesday said in part. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR During his previous stint at OPD, Fairow earned the nickname \"Straight Arrow\" Fairow, for following procedure by the book. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A deputy chief at BART since 2011, Fairow was named in a lawsuit by the widow of Sgt. Tom Smith, accidentally killed by detective Michael Maes in a friendly fire shooting while serving a search warrant in 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The suit alleges that BART, under the leadership of Fairow and Rainey, increased its number of searches while de-emphasizing the use of specially trained SWAT and other tactical units, and that Fairow used profanity in dismissing requests from Smith and others for advanced training.

       "291  Claims that US diplomats suffered mysterious brain injuries after being targeted with a secret weapon in Cuba have been challenged by neurologists and other brain specialists. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A medical report commissioned by the US government, published in March, found that staff at the US embassy in Havana suffered concussion-like brain damage after hearing strange noises in homes and hotels, but doctors from the US, the UK and Germany have contested the conclusions. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In four separate letters to the Journal of the American Medical Association, which published the original medical study, groups of doctors specialising in neurology, neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology described what they believed were major flaws in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Cuba says 'undefined sounds' at home left US embassy official feeling ill Read more NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Among the criticisms, published on Tuesday, are that the University of Pennsylvania team which assessed the diplomats misinterpreted test results, overlooked common disorders that might have made the workers feel sick, or dismissed psychological explanations for their symptoms. Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania defended their report in a formal response in the journal, but the specialists told the Guardian they stood by their criticisms. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The US withdrew more than half of its Havana diplomats last year and expelled 15 Cubans after 24 embassy staff and family reported a bizarre list of symptoms, ranging from headaches, dizziness and difficulties in sleeping, to problems with concentration, balance, vision and hearing. Many said their symptoms developed after they heard strange noises, described as cicada-like chirps, grinding, or the buffeting caused by an open window in the car. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The accounts led Washington to claim the diplomats had been victims of “acoustic attacks”, though an FBI investigation found no evidence that sonic weapons were involved. Physicists have voiced doubts that such weapons were even feasible. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR At the request of the US government, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania ran checks on 21 diplomats and investigated six with a further 37 tests. Led by Doug Smith, the director of the university’s centre for brain injury, the team concluded that the patients had concussion-like injuries caused by damage to “widespread brain networks”. The state department now cites the medical report on its travel advice pages and urges people to reconsider visiting Cuba. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The doctors who contacted the journal disagreed with the diagnosis. Robert Shura, a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist at Salisbury veterans affairs medical centre in North Carolina, and two colleagues, said Smith’s team had misinterpreted cognitive tests performed on the diplomats. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Doctors said Smith’s team too easily dismissed functional neurological disorders such as “acoustic shock”, which affects telephone operators who hear sudden loud noises in their headsets. Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It is standard practice to compare people’s scores on such tests with others in the population. A score in the bottom 5% would typically mean there is a problem. But Shura pointed out that the diplomats were found to be “impaired” if they scored in the bottom 40% in any one of the tests. In their letter, the doctors said it was “inappropriate” to conclude that any of the patients were impaired. “It is more likely than not that all six of the patients whose data are reported had normal neuropsychological profiles,” Shura told the Guardian. Other specialists have published the same criticism. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In another letter, doctors including Gerard Gianoli from the Ear and Balance Institute in Louisiana argued that the test results pointed to inner ear damage rather than concussion and called for more thorough testing. “Given that almost all of the patients complained of hearing loss and balance problems, I am extremely suspicious of an inner ear insult in this group of patients,” Gianoli said. “I do wish they would be more thoroughly evaluated.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Cuba ‘sonic attack’ conspiracy theories and flawed science | Letter Read more NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In a third letter to the journal, Jon Stone, a consultant neurologist, and Alan Carson, a consultant neuropsychiatrist, both at the University of Edinburgh, argue with Stoyan Popkirov, a neurologist in Bochum, that Smith’s team too easily dismissed so-called functional neurological disorders. These can be triggered by sudden noises which, combined with anxiety and heightened attention, lead to real and persistent neurological problems.

       "735  Over the past year, Michael Flynn sat down with federal investigators 19 times, answering questions and providing evidence. On Tuesday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller shared just a small amount of what he told them in a legal filing that should spook the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A year and three days since President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, Mueller filed two brief legal documents calling for him to spend no time in prison over it. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In the filings, Mueller, a decorated Marine veteran, pointedly noted that Flynn — unlike “every other person who has been charged” in the special counsel investigation — had a long record of military and public service, which made his initial lies to the government all the more confounding. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But the tone of the filing was much different from Mueller’s filings on former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who reported to a federal prison camp last week, and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, who Mueller said breached a cooperation agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR After a daylong buildup of anticipation to the filing of the Flynn sentencing document, it turned out to say little that wasn’t already known. In January of 2017, Flynn lied to the FBI about a conversation he had with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak just a month earlier, falsely telling investigators that he hadn’t discussed sanctions with him. That conversation took place the day the Obama Administration announced it was imposing sanctions on Russia for attempting to interfere in the election, raising questions about whether he violated the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments about official disputes. He also lied about discussing a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements with Kislyak. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Two months later, Flynn failed to fully disclose the nature of his work in Turkey when registering with the government as a foreign agent, omitting the fact that he had worked on a project at the direction of the Turkish government while advising the Trump campaign on national security issues. Additionally, he failed to disclose that he authored an op-ed on behalf of the Turkish government about the attempted coup, falsely stating he wrote it of his own volition. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Flynn had revealed during his court appearance last year that he was cooperating with the Special Counsel’s office, but the filings reveal both the extent and the implications for the probe as a whole. Mueller noted that Flynn later worked extensively with the special counsel’s investigation, likely prompting other witnesses to be more forthcoming. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation,” Mueller wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But several parts of the addendum were blacked out in the publicly available version, including a section describing a criminal investigation, a second investigation that is entirely redacted, a portion describing interactions between the Trump transition team and Russia and a brief description of one way that Flynn cooperated. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Some of Trump’s allies were quick to declare victory for the President. “Everyone’s going to focus on what has been redacted,” Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News. “But let’s look at what’s not in there. There is no suggestion that Michael Flynn had anything to do with collusion. He was with the transition team, he was part of the campaign, and yet there’s no mention of collusion. I think it’s good news for President Trump tonight that this is what it’s come down to.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But Democrats, as well as some legal experts, disagreed. While this filing doesn’t spell out the President’s legal vulnerabilities, they argue, it provides a glimpse of the wealth of information he has accumulated about the Trump campaign’s conduct. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “What this suggests is there is one more major ball to drop and we don’t know what that is,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Rep.

       "940  KIEV, Ukraine — In an effort to stabilize Ukraine and extend its authority, the interim government has set a deadline of Friday for turning in the illegal firearms that are now carried openly by so-called self-defense groups in Independence Square, the politically important plaza in the center of the capital. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The order was seconded on Thursday by the French ambassador to Ukraine, Alain Rémy, who said the disarmament of the militias that helped overthrow the former government is a central requirement for the European Union to begin disbursing financial aid, along with the government fighting corruption. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who was a staunch supporter of the protesters but never condoned violent tactics, set the deadline for Friday, the day Ukraine is scheduled to sign the political articles of an association agreement with the European Union. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “For those who want to defend their country with an assault rifle in their hands, welcome to the National Guard or the Army,” Mr. Yatsenyuk said in a speech this week. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the self-organized defense groups that formed to defend Independence Square and other protest sites during the uprising have been reluctant to comply. Like gun owners in countries like the United States and Switzerland where ownership of firearms is widespread, they contend that the weapons are needed to defend the country against a possible foreign invasion and to defend their freedoms from potential government abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s not normal to ask people to hand in their weapons in the situation we have now,” Dmytro Yarosh, the leader of a right-wing paramilitary group, Right Sector, said in an interview this week. His organization opposes the request to surrender its weapons, but will comply with the law, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Yarosh said lawyers with his group were drafting a bill for consideration in Parliament that was modeled on Swiss notions of firearms possession, in which an armed population is seen as a quick deterrent against a foreign invasion. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “Allow people to keep weapons at home,” Mr. Yarosh said, describing the logic of gun ownership in the context of Ukraine. “Then, when the enemy walks down the streets of your country, you can shoot him right from your own window.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Members of Right Sector have not just hunting rifles but also military weapons that were seized from an Interior Ministry arsenal in western Ukraine in the final days of the uprising. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The hunting weapons are legal, if the owner has a permit. In Ukraine, people 21 and older may apply for a license to own a shotgun for hunting, and those 25 and older may apply for a permit to own a rifle. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Pistols that fire nonlethal plastic or rubber bullets are also legal for citizens who can demonstrate a risk of assault because of their profession, which in Ukraine can include law enforcement officers for off-duty use, civil servants and journalists. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The self-defense units have been reluctant to describe in detail the seized military weapons, which were from an arsenal outside the city of Lviv. Mr. Yarosh said Right Sector helped move the weapons to the capital in late February. Today, he said of his supporters, “in part they handed in these weapons, in part they keep them.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The military weapons reached the capital too late to play a role in the street fighting, protest leaders have said. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Continue reading the main story Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the opposition street fighters who clashed with the police in Kiev in February carried only baseball bats and other improvised bludgeons, like lead pipes or table legs with nails driven through the ends. But analysts said it was the size of the crowds, rather than weaponry, that was the pivotal political factor. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The interim government is now seeking to integrate the loosely organized militias into a newly formed national guard, though several hard-line groups, including Right Sector, have declined to join. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR At the group’s headquarters in the Dnipro Hotel here, where men in jeans and military fatigues guarded the hallways this week, some of them with black-and-red bandannas over their faces, a man with a submachine gun stood guard outside the office of Mr. Yarosh.

       "885  Park officials are investigating how and why a 68-year-old man fell to his death in Acadia National Park on Monday, the National Park Service said Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Simon of Glen Ridge, New Jersey, fell from a bluff between Sand Beach and Thunder Hole. Simon was a summer resident of Southwest Harbor. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR He and his wife had stopped on the Park Loop Road so he could photograph the sunset from an area off the Ocean Path.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Rangers located Simon’s backpack, and then saw his body at the bottom of a 40-foot drop. He was lying motionless at the water’s edge. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Because of the steep terrain, park rangers could not reach him, and the U.S. Coast Guard was called to assist in recovering Simon’s body, which was only reached once the rising tide carried it into the water. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR While the fall appears accidental, the National Park Service said it would continue to investigate the circumstances Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Share ||||| Bill Trotter | BDN Bill Trotter | BDN NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR By Bill Trotter , BDN Staff • June 7, 2016 12:32 pm NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Updated: June 7, 2016 4:59 pm NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR ACADIA NATIONAL PARK, Maine — A New Jersey man died Monday night after falling from a seaside cliff in Acadia, according to park officials. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Simon, 68, a resident of Glen Ridge, New Jersey, who spent summers on Mount Desert Island in Southwest Harbor, is believed to have fallen from a cliff near Thunder Hole after going out on the rocks to take photographs of the sunset, Acadia National Park spokesman John Kelly said Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Simon’s wife stayed in their car in a nearby parking lot when Simon walked to the shore shortly after 7 p.m. to take photographs, Kelly said. After her husband did not return, she waved down a park ranger, who was driving by a few minutes after 9:30 p.m., he added. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR About a half-hour later, rangers found Simon’s backpack at the top of the cliff, which is about 40 feet tall, Kelly said. They saw him lying at the bottom of the cliff, but he was unresponsive to their calls. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Because of Simon’s location, rangers requested assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard and from Mount Desert Island Search & Rescue, but the incoming tide carried Simon’s body offshore, Kelly said. The Coast Guard, which sent two boats to assist in the search, located and pulled Simon’s body from the water around 11:30 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Simon’s body was taken to the Bar Harbor town pier, then was taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Augusta, according to Kelly. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Belserene, spokesman for the medical examiner’s office, said Tuesday afternoon that an autopsy has been performed on Simon but the cause of death is not expected to be determined for at least a few weeks, pending the results of lab tests. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Kelly said that though Simon’s fall appears to be accidental, the National Park Service is investigating the circumstances of the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Falls are not uncommon in Acadia and, according to Kelly, are the main cause of injury in the park, whether they result in a twisted ankle or a fatality. During the busy summer months, park rangers have been known to deal with multiple simultaneous calls about hikers who have fallen and injured themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Most of those instances in which rangers provide assistance involve injuries that are not life-threatening and are considered relatively minor, according to Kelly. The last time someone is known to have died after taking a serious fall in Acadia was in 2012, when a University of Maine student fell off Precipice Trail. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It is the second fatality in the park this year. In January, Ellsworth resident Timothy Philpott went missing while hiking in Acadia, prompting several searches over the ensuing days and weeks as weather conditions allowed. His remains were found in mid-April. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Belserene said Tuesday that the medical examiner’s office subsequently determined that Philpott’s cause of death was “acute intoxication” from multiple prescription medications. ||||| BAR HARBOR, Maine (NEWS CENTER) — A man from Glen Ridge, N.J., fell to his death Monday at Acadia National Park.

       "387  A well-done movie musical is a great equalizer: It can make audiences feel like they’re in the front row at a Broadway show without the sticker shock. Bill Condon’s lavish live-action “Beauty and the Beast” pulls this off, sticking closely enough to the original that it should satisfy its legions of fans — among which, I confess, I’ve never really counted myself. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The 1991 “Beauty” always felt like minor Disney to me, a step down for the “Little Mermaid” team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. But, devotees, let’s agree to disagree because this version of the tale about a cursed prince and the plucky bookworm whose love redeems him has something for everyone. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Emma Watson fleshes out the heroine, Belle, courtesy of screenwriters Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos. She’s a fledgling inventor (instead of her dad, Maurice, played by Kevin Kline), a mentor to girls in her 18th-century village who want to read, and is unafraid to tell her boorish suitor, Gaston (a perfect, preening Luke Evans) that she’s too young have kids. Watson carries a passable tune, and her eyes have the sparkle of a damsel who’s prepared to come to her own rescue. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Dan Stevens (“Downton Abbey”), as the Beast, has the heaviest lift. He’s emoting through a CGI veil that never quite feels real. But his cranky character is more engaging this time around. He’s a fellow reader who doesn’t treat Belle with chivalrous kid gloves. In their snowball fight, he actually goes through with lobbing a gigantic one at her, knocking her to the ground. It’s a weirdly slapstick moment, but I liked it. When has a Disney princess ever been treated like the love interest in a Farrelly brothers movie? NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The castle’s animated inanimate objects — a candlestick (Ewan McGregor), clock (Ian McKellen), teapot (Emma Thompson), wardrobe (Audra McDonald) and feather duster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), plus Stanley Tucci as a piano — stump along pretty much like they did in the cartoon. McGregor’s rendition of “Be Our Guest” is a retro-styled showstopper, though I can’t say the same of the three new songs, which just increase the soundtrack’s clunkers-to-classics ratio. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR And about that gay subplot? Yup, it’s obvious LeFou (Josh Gad, every musical’s secret weapon) has a thing for his buddy — the tavern singalong “Gaston,” the film’s best number, all but spells it out. There’s a brief shot of two men dancing, and a scene in which one redneck villager, magicked into a dress and makeup, responds with delight instead of horror. It’s also worth noting that Ashman, who died of complications from AIDS in 1991, saw the cursed Beast as a metaphor for the disease. So if you loved the original, you’ve already embraced a gay subtext. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Other (light) modernist touches abound. The witch, who initially curses the prince, pops up throughout the film: “Do you know what happens to spinsters whose fathers die?” Gaston growls at Belle, gesturing at a beggar woman. She’ll later be the one who saves Belle’s dad. When Gaston fearmongers villagers into storming the Beast’s castle, it hums with a certain topicality; likewise the flock of books fighting back against an illiterate mob. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Really, everybody wins. If you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that’s what you’ll get. Those who always desired a little more depth from “Beauty and the Beast” will be happy, too: There’s something there that wasn’t there before. ||||| Video (01:59) : The fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In 1991, Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” became the first animated film nominated for the best picture Oscar. The studio’s live action and computer-graphic remake likely won’t have to worry about the Academy Awards. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Don’t misunderstand: It is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza. It musically honors its earlier version, providing greatest-hits cover versions of the classic songs by Alan Menken, plus four originals. It welcomes a new generation of viewers with the “Harry Potter” audience appeal of Emma Watson in the progressive, quasi-feminist leading role. In short, the movie, directed by Bill Condon (of “Chicago,” “Dreamgirls” and two “Twilight Saga” entries), is fine. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Beauty and the Beast ★★½ out of 4 stars Rating: PG, some action, violence, peril and frightening images. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But it’s also less magical than what the studio achieved with two-dimensional illustrations a quarter-century ago.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian opposition activists have released haunting footage showing a young boy rescued from the rubble in the aftermath of a devastating airstrike in Aleppo. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The image of the stunned and weary looking boy, sitting in an orange chair inside an ambulance covered in dust and with blood on his face, encapsulates the horrors inflicted on the conflicted northern city and is being widely shared on social media. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Doctor in Aleppo on Thursday identified the boy as 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh. Osama Abu al-Ezz confirmed he was brought to the hospital known as \"M10\" Wednesday night following an airstrike on the rebel-held district of Qaterji with head wounds, but no brain injury, and was later discharged. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors in Aleppo use code names for hospitals, which they say have been systematically targeted by government airstrikes. Abu al-Ezz said they do that \"because we are afraid security forces will infiltrate their medical network and target ambulances as they transfer patients from one hospital to another.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In the video posted late Wednesday by the Aleppo Media Center, a man is seen plucking the boy away from a chaotic nighttime scene and carrying him inside the ambulance, looking dazed and flat-eyed. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The boy then runs his hand over his blood-covered face, looks at his hands and wipes them on the ambulance chair. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition activists said there were eight casualties overall from the air strike on Qaterji, among them five children. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The image of Omran in the orange chair is reminiscent of the image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy whose body was found on a beach in Turkey and came to encapsulate the horrific toll of Syria's civil war. |||||\\n   \n",

The 57-year-old musician had been suffering from the flu for weeks and had canceled two shows earlier this month but performed Thursday night in Atlanta despite still feeling under the weather. He was flying home to Minnesota after the show when his plane was forced to stop in Illinois, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Prince was taken to the hospital and released three hours later. A source tells the Star Tribune that Prince had \"bad dehydration\" but is \"all good\" at home now. (Prince appeared to be in better health—possibly better than any 57-year-old in history—earlier this year when the internet lost it over his passport photo.)\\n   \n",

Fairow—who replaced resigning police chief Sean Whent on Friday amid an investigation into possible underage sex and murder—was removed from his post Wednesday after just six days, reports the Los Angeles Times. During a background check, Mayor Libby Schaaf says she received information that \"raised concerns for me about whether [Fairow] can effectively lead this department at this particular moment in time.\" She didn't elaborate, but the chief of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department—where Fairow previously served and will return—says Fairow told him he had an affair with a consenting adult while married more than a decade ago, per the AP. Fairow worked for the Oakland Police Department at that time. Sources tell the East Bay Times that the other party was an employee, though a BART rep denies that. While an officer's suicide note first suggested that four Oakland officers were involved with an underage prostitute, the woman now claims she had sexual contact with some two dozen officers from various agencies in exchange for protection or knowledge of prostitution stings in the works, including while she was underage; she is now 18. A Contra Costa County Sheriff's deputy has been suspended, two Oakland officers have resigned, and three are on administrative leave. \"We are dealing with disgusting allegations that upset me greatly,\" says Schaaf. \"I believe that the leadership at this time is critical in order to build confidence that the culture of this department does not tolerate unethical behavior, sexual misconduct, or lying.\" Assistant Police Chief Paul Figueroa has been appointed acting chief while the department searches for a permanent replacement.\\n   \n",

A major study commissioned by the US government found that diplomats suffered concussion-like symptoms, and many of them reported hearing strange noises before falling ill. Now, however, four separate letters by scientists in the US and several other nations are challenging that initial study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, reports the Guardian. The critics, writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, say the Penn researchers misinterpreted results and too easily dismissed causes such as a \"mass psychogenic illness.\" The Penn researchers, meanwhile, are standing by their work and say additional research continues. Highlights: Psychological? Robert Bartholomew, a US scientist who works in New Zealand, makes the case for a \"mass psychogenic illness,\" also known as mass hysteria, reports BuzzFeed. The Cuban illnesses have all the hallmarks, he says, and he faults the Penn researchers for not investigating how closely the victims knew each other, and perhaps fed off each other in terms of symptoms. Inner ear: Another critic faults the first study for not focusing more on potential inner ear trouble. \"Almost all of the patients complained of hearing loss and balance problems,\" writes Gerard Gianoli of Louisana's Ear and Balance Institute. “I do wish they would be more thoroughly evaluated.” Cognitive results: The Penn researchers found that some victims suffered cognitive damage, but another researcher thinks they're wrong. The Penn scientists considered subjects \"impaired\" if they scored in the bottom 40% of tests; the more accepted benchmark would be closer to 5%.\\n   \n",

Indeed, in addition to providing information on \"interactions between individuals in the presidential transition team and Russia,\" and claiming such individuals directed him to discuss sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the US, Trump's former national security adviser cooperated in a criminal investigation separate from the Russia probe, the filing states, per USA Today.

Mark Meadows says \"no mention of collusion\" is \"good news for President Trump,\" per Time, though a former federal prosecutor tells CNN he believes \"Flynn provided information that is allowing Mueller to make a criminal case against someone.\" Mueller notes Flynn's decision to cooperate, which likely encouraged other witnesses to follow suit, \"was particularly valuable because he was one of the first people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation.\" These words differ greatly from those Mueller has used to describe Paul Manafort, suggesting \"full disclosure will be rewarded while attempts to thwart him … will be severely punished,\" CNN reports, mentioning \"Trump's Twitter praise for associates such as Roger Stone, who have refused to cooperate with Mueller\" and his criticisms of those who've agreed.

       "940                                                                                     – Vladimir Putin officially signed the bills completing Russia's annexation of Crimea today, hailing the move as a \"remarkable event,\" the AP reports. It was one of the day's two auspicious signings; earlier, interim Ukrainian President Arseniy Yatsenyuk signed on to what Reuters refers to as a \"landmark\" political association agreement with the European Union. It was ousted president Viktor Yanukovich's opposition to the pact—in favor of closer ties to Russia—that started the protests that began the crisis. The deal calls for greater political and economic cooperation, and eventually free trade once a new president is elected in May. Yatsenyuk said the deal indicated that the EU would \"speak in one single and strong voice\" to support the Ukraine, CNN reports. As for that other signing? \"Frankly, I don't care about Russia signing\" the annexation bill, Yatsenyuk said. \"I care about Ukraine, Ukrainians, and our European future.\" In other Ukraine news: Ukraine set today as the deadline for the militias patrolling Independence Square in Kiev to turn in the illegal weapons that they openly carry, the New York Times reports. Europe is insisting the groups disarm before any financial aid flows to Ukraine. Ukrainian troops will today join NATO training exercises in Bulgaria, the AP reports. The exercises were planned before the crisis broke, but take on an extra significance now. Vladimir Putin laughed off US sanctions, RT reports. Referring to the targeted lawmakers he derisively said, \"Yes, these are those so-called 'polite people in camouflage with guns.' ... I need to avoid these citizens as they are 'compromising the country.'\" He also said that he'd open an account at the sanctioned Rossiya bank. But Russia won't issue retaliatory sanctions, he said, and it will keep repairing NATO helicopters in Afghanistan. Apparently retaliatory visa bans are another matter.\\n   \n",

The Bangor Daily News reports Mark Simon was visiting the park with his wife, who waited in the car in a nearby parking lot while he walked to a bluff to take photos. She got concerned when the sun went down and stopped a park ranger who was driving by, according to the Portland Press Herald. Her husband had been gone for more than two hours. The ranger found Simon's backpack at the top of a nearby cliff, WCSH reports. His body was 40 feet below at the water's edge. The tide carried Simon's body away from shore before rescuers could get to it, and the Coast Guard was called to pull it from the water. While Simon's death is believed to be accidental, the National Park Service is investigating and an autopsy is underway. Simon is the second person to die in Acadia National Park this year. A hiker was found dead of acute intoxication in January. And while falls are frequent in the park, there hasn't been a fatal one since 2012.\\n   \n",
       "387  – Disney's original Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. In other words, its live-action remake starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens has a tough act to follow. According to critics, it's good—but doesn't quite measure up to the original. The general reaction: \"If you thought it was a bad idea to mess with a classic, Beauty and the Beast will persuade you that a tale as old as time is worth retelling,\" writes Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. While it's \"not quite as good as its predecessor,\" it's still \"a vastly entertaining film that combines old-school charm with technological wizardry,\" he adds, giving props to both Watson and Stevens. Colin Covert agrees this retelling is \"less magical\" than the 1991 original, \"an underperforming example of more being considerably less,\" he writes at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. But he also finds much to enjoy, from \"the subplot of egotistical Gaston\" to the impressive detail in the computer imagery. In short, \"it is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza.\" Sara Stewart actually thinks this new version is better than the original, partly because the Beast is \"more engaging.\" But the film as a whole \"has something for everyone,\" she writes at the New York Post. \"If you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that's what you'll get. Those who always desired a little more depth from Beauty and the Beast will be happy, too.\" One who was not happy: Joe Morgenstern. He argues the film \"betrays the essence of what made the 1991 animated feature a beloved classic\" through \"a succession of disjunctures, missed moments and dubious deviations from the earlier script.\" It feels \"crazily cluttered\" and Watson's Belle is bland to boot, he writes at the Wall Street Journal. He does, however, praise the \"huge jolts of visual energy.\" The film features Disney's first \"exclusively gay moment,\" even if the reference is subtle.\\n   \n",

The staff at Bright Beginnings Inc. was stunned by his move. \"It is evident that John Wall is sensitive and concerned about the plight of homeless children in DC and he wants these children to succeed,\" the executive director says on the group's Facebook page, where heartwarming pictures of Wall interacting with the BBI kids are also displayed. It's not the first time Wall has shown his soft spot for kids: He still raises funds in honor of a 6-year-old cancer patient he befriended who passed away last year, the Washington Post notes.

The image of the stunned and weary-looking boy, sitting in an orange chair inside an ambulance covered in dust and with blood on his face, encapsulates the horrors inflicted on the conflicted northern city and is being widely shared on social media, the AP reports. On Thursday, a doctor in Aleppo identified the boy as 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh. The doctor confirmed he was brought to a hospital Wednesday night following an airstrike on the rebel-held district of Qaterji with head wounds, but no brain injury, and was later discharged. In a video posted late Wednesday by the Aleppo Media Center, a man is seen plucking the boy away from a chaotic nighttime scene and carrying him inside the ambulance, looking dazed and flat-eyed. The boy then runs his hand over his blood-covered face, looks at his hands, and wipes them on the ambulance chair. Opposition activists say there were eight casualties overall from the airstrike on Qaterji, among them five children.
