NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It also took the opportunity to threaten South Korea with “final destruction” during a United Nations Conference on Disarmament last month.

Intercut with images of North Korean artillery and missiles, the video also shows a target homing in on the White House. \"The White House is caught in the panoramic sight of a long-range missile,\" reads a caption. \"This hotbed of war is in the scope of a nuclear bomb blow.\" The video comes after months of alarming moves by Pyongyang. The North has tested a rocket and a nuclear weapon, threatened to nuke the US, and announced the end of the armistice that has kept peace on the Korean peninsula. One analyst blames the escalation on new leader Kim Jong Un's need to \"prove himself\" to North Korea's military: \"My take is that it is overwhelmingly bluster for domestic reasons, not international ones,\" she says.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Coalition forces bombarded Libya for a third straight night Monday, targeting the air defenses and forces of Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, stopping his advances and handing some momentum back to the rebels, who were on the verge of defeat just last week. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But the rebellion's more organized military units were still not ready, and the opposition disarray underscored U.S. warnings that a long stalemate could emerge. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The air campaign by U.S. and European militaries has unquestionably rearranged the map in Libya and rescued rebels from the immediate threat they faced only days ago of being crushed under a powerful advance by Gadhafi's forces. The first round of airstrikes smashed a column of regime tanks that had been moving on the rebel capital of Benghazi in the east. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Monday night, Libyan state TV said a new round of strikes had begun in the capital, Tripoli, marking the third night of bombardment. But while the airstrikes can stop Gadhafi's troops from attacking rebel cities _ in line with the U.N. mandate to protect civilians _ the United States, at least, appeared deeply reluctant to go beyond that toward actively helping the rebel cause to oust the Libyan leader. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama said Monday that \"it is U.S. policy that Gadhafi has to go.\" But, he said, the international air campaign has a more limited goal, to protect civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our military action is in support of an international mandate from the Security Council that specifically focuses on the humanitarian threat posed by Col. Gadhafi to his people. Not only was he carrying out murders of civilians but he threatened more,\" the president said on a visit to Chile. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington, the American general running the assault said there is no attempt to provide air cover for rebel operations. Gen. Carter Ham said Gadhafi might cling to power once the bombardment finishes, setting up a stalemate between his side and the rebels, with allied nations enforcing a no-fly zone to ensure he cannot attack civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR At the United Nations Monday, the Security Council turned down a request by Libya for an emergency session. Libya wanted \"an emergency meeting in order to halt this aggression.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Henri Guaino, a top adviser to the French president, said the allied effort would last \"a while yet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Among the rebels, as well, there was a realization that fighting could be drawn out. Mohammed Abdul-Mullah, a 38-year-old civil engineer from Benghazi who was fighting with the rebel force, said government troops stopped all resistance after the international campaign began. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"The balance has changed a lot,\" he said. \"But pro-Gadhafi forces are still strong. They are a professional military and they have good equipment. Ninety percent of us rebels are civilians, while Gadhafi's people are professional fighters.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Disorganization among the rebels could also hamper their attempts to exploit the turn of events. Since the uprising began, the opposition has been made up of disparate groups even as it took control of the entire east of the country. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Regular citizens _ residents of the \"liberated\" areas _ took up arms and formed a ragtag, highly enthusiastic but highly undisciplined force that in the past weeks has charged ahead to fight Gadhafi forces, only to be beaten back by superior firepower. Regular army units that joined the rebellion have proven stronger, more organized fighters, but only a few units have joined the battles while many have stayed behind as officers struggle to get together often antiquated, limited equipment and form a coordinated force. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Discord also plagued the coalition. The U.S. was eager to pass leadership off, but the allies were deeply divided on the issue. Turkey was adamantly against NATO taking charge, while Italy hinted Monday it would stop allowing use of its airfields if the veteran alliance is not given the leadership. Germany and Russia also criticized the way the mission is being carried out. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin railed against the U.N.-backed airstrikes as outside meddling \"reminiscent of a medieval call for a Crusade.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In contrast, the British parliament lent clear support, voting 557 to 13 in favor of using armed forces to enforce the Security Council resolution to use \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians in Libya.

The campaign to destroy Moammar Gadhafi's air defenses and establish a no-fly zone is almost complete, and American officials are seeking to hand over leadership of the operation to European allies, reports the New York Times. \"My sense is that unless something unusual or unexpected happens, we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks, \" said Gen. Carter Ham. Coalition forces aren't attempting to provide air cover for rebels, he added, warning of a potentially long stalemate between Gadhafi's forces and the rebels, AP reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Evan S. Medeiros, who until this year was the top official overseeing Asia at the National Security Council, said that the explicit threat of sanctions against companies differed from earlier sales, when the threat was more implicit. At the same time, Mr. Medeiros noted, earlier arms sales resulted in the suspension of meetings between the two militaries, which was not part of China’s initial response to the sale this time. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Medeiros, who now leads the Asia practice for the Eurasia Group in Washington, said that the timing of the sale, coming before next month’s presidential elections in Taiwan, helped to reduce the diplomatic fallout.

But Mr. Ma’s party, the Kuomintang, is expected to lose the presidency to the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors a more distant relationship with the mainland and the assertion of Taiwan’s own identity. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “The timing clearly was calibrated to avoid having to do it after the election,” Mr. Medeiros said, speaking in a telephone interview from Taiwan, where he was meeting officials. “That would have been particularly provocative.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The sale is significantly smaller than the $5.8 billion package approved by the United States in 2011, and it is not expected to alter the military balance across the Taiwan Strait, which has tilted in Beijing’s favor after years of large increases in military spending by the mainland, whose annual military budget is now more than 13 times greater than Taiwan’s. Absent from the arms package is any assistance from the United States to help build diesel-electric submarines, a top priority for Taiwan, which wants to replace its aging fleet.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Any sanctions against military contractors would most likely be limited because American weapons makers have been banned for more than a quarter-century from selling arms to mainland China.

Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters. China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and \"severely\" damages China's sovereignty. \"China's government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies,\" a ministry spokesman says.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month and raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The Labor Department's monthly jobs report, the last major economic data before Tuesday's congressional elections, also showed that the unemployment rate remained at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The influx of new job-seekers in October increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years and are spending freely and propelling brisk economic growth. The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such period on record, and October marked the 100th straight month of hiring, a record streak. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The resulting strength in customer demand has led companies to steadily add workers. Though economists predict that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there's no sign of that happening yet. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the latest month of healthy job growth might not tip many votes in the midterm elections. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy's performance, that sentiment hasn't necessarily broadened support for President Donald Trump or Republican congressional candidates. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In October, consumer confidence reached its highest point in 18 years, propelled by optimism about the job market. Last month's plunge in stock prices didn't dampen Americans' enthusiasm, though the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the full market decline had occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In the July-September quarter, consumer spending grew by the most in four years and helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That growth followed a 4.2 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter. Combined, the two quarters produced the strongest six-month stretch of growth in four years. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Manufacturing output and hiring remain healthy, according to a survey by a private trade association, although increased tariffs have raised factory costs. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR By contrast, housing remains a weak spot in the economy, with sales of existing homes having fallen for six straight months as mortgage rates have risen to nearly 5 percent. But slower sales have started to limit home price increases, which had been running at more than twice the pace of wage gains. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR There are signs that pay growth is picking up. A measure of wage and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the best such showing in a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Although pay increases can help boost spending and propel the economy's growth, they can also lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. That trend, in turn, can accelerate inflation. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR So far, though, inflation remains in check. The Federal Reserve's preferred price measure rose 2 percent in September compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the year-over-year increase in August. |||||\\n</td>\n",

Executives from Research in Motion have gathered for a six-city, simultaneous launch of BlackBerry 10, a mobile operating system that will power a new series of phones (and who knows what else). In one hour we’ll hear about the all-new BlackBerry 10 platfor, and two new phones, rumored to be called the Z10 and X10. Here in New York, hundreds of analysts, journalists and industry observers are bustling around the blue-tinted environs of Pier 36 in the Lower East Side for the launch which starts at 10am EST (7am Pacific). NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Some are skeptical about today’s launch. RIM’s global market share is down to roughly 6% from a peak of 20% just three years ago; its shares are down 80% in the same period. This is a story of how quickly even dominant players in the new world of telecoms can fall behind if they stall in development: take a breath and you’re king of the industry; let it out and someone’s just overtaken you. In RIM’s case, iPhones and Android phones became the devices everyone wanted for both work and play, crimping RIM’s marketshare after a peak in 2009. A trickier-than-expected transition from RIM’s purchase of QNX in 2010 didn’t help matters. QNX technology will now power BB10. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Today is widely seen as the company’s last shot at relevance, a cliched Hail Mary Pass. It has laid off thousands of employees to save $1 billion in costs, but today RIM is pulling out the stops with a big launch venue. Stay tuned… NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 9.37 am EST: The main hall has opened for press, with Hot Chip thumping through the speakers. And some nice news for RIM’s shares: they’re currently up 4.2% after a two-day decline. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 9.46am EST: The rest of the launch attendees are filling up the main hall – it’s getting loud and busy. Not long now. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:06 am EST: Our MC has taken to the stage and we’re starting with video link-ups with the five other launch events around the world: London, Dubai, Toronto Paris and Johannesburg. The crowd in Toronto looks especially excited. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:13 am EST: We’re seeing a couple of videos from industry and die-hard consumer fans of the BlackBerry. If you’re interested, you can watch them here. And here is a guy who has been growing his hair until the launch of BlackBerry 10 – a stage hand has just snipped off his pony tail in front of the cheering audience. That was cute. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:14 am EST: And now, RIM’s chief executive, Thorsten Heins has taken to the stage. Looking relaxed in a grey suit with no tie. It’s been almost one year exactly since I was handed the reins of Research in Motion and it has easily bee the most challenging year of my career to date… but also the most exhilarating and rewarding.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:20 am EST: Heins: “We will soon give you more ways to connect your mobile experience to the world around you… We will be a leader in connecting you to your Internet of Things.” This is what RIM means when they talk about BlackBerry 10 being for hyper-connected consumers. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:23 am EST: Heins says RIM had to make the tough decision to “go it alone” with its own software platform. He is publicly thanking RIM’s engineers and carrier partners. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10.27 am EST: Transitioning to RIM’s new phase it took heartfelt and brutal honesty with ourselves. We have transformed ourselves inside and out. Some big news: Research in Motion has rebranded itself as just BlackBerry.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10.28 am EST: And here are the two new phones: the touchscreen Z10 and the Q10, a phone with a physical keyboard. The phones boast 1080p video recording. “Aren’t they beautiful?” asks Heins. (The rumors were almost right. Reports initially called them the Z10 and “X10″) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:31 am EST: The devices have a “glass-weave” cover. Now Vivek Bhardwaj, head of BlackBerry’s software portfolio takes to the stage to demonstrate BlackBerry 10.

Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the \"heartfelt and brutal honesty\" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes. It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the Q10 was created for customers \"that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience,\" reports USA Today. The company also added some star power, announcing that Alicia Keys would be its new Global Creative director, a position created for her, the Verge reports. The company also boasted that Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project. On to the features. First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft's latest Windows iteration. BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry's dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile. As for hardware, BlackBerry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR [If you or someone you know is in immediate danger or having a medical emergency, call 911.] NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) is a toll-free hotline in the US for people in distress who feel like they are at risk of harming themselves. But what actually happens when you call? D3sign / Getty Images / Via gettyimages.com Suicide is complicated and sometimes hard to predict, but health experts say it can be preventable. That's why there are services like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and the hope is that people will use them if they, or someone they know, are having a crisis. But for many people, there is still some mystery about what actually happens during these calls, and some misconceptions can keep people from picking up the phone. So we put together a step-by-step guide about what to expect when you call a suicide hotline. Keep in mind, however, that everyone who calls into a suicide hotline may have a slightly different conversation and experience. And there are also hundreds of different suicide and crisis-prevention hotlines and chat services. For the purposes of this post, we will focus on the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and another line that you can text, called the Crisis Text Line. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR First, the basics: Lifeline provides free, confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for anyone of any age — including non-English speakers. Anyone can call the Lifeline, whether they are thinking about suicide or not, and get emotional support. There is no minimum age, and you can receive support at any time, even on holidays. As long as you have a phone, you can call the number and talk to someone. Lifeline is also available for non-English speakers and people who are deaf or hard of hearing. If you are a Spanish speaker, call the Spanish-language Lifeline at 1-888-628-9454. Si hablas español, llama a 1-888-628-9454. Lifeline ofrece 24/7, gratuito servicios en español. If you speak another language, call the main line and wait to be connected to a person at a local crisis center who can connect with a translator. According to Lifeline's website, the crisis centers work with a service that can translate calls in over 150 languages. People who are deaf or hard of hearing can reach Lifeline via TTY by dialing 1-800-799-4889 or use the Lifeline Live Chat service online. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR When you first call, you will get an automated greeting with additional options. A person does not come on the line immediately. After dialing 1-800-273-8255, you will hear the following automated message: \"You have reached the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, also servicing the Veterans service line. If you are in emotional distress or suicidal crisis or are concerned about someone who might be, we're here to help. Please remain on the line while we route your call to the nearest crisis center in our network.\" The automated message also provides additional options for Spanish speakers and veterans. If you speak Spanish, press two. If you are a veteran or an active duty member of the military or calling about someone who is, you can press one. \"We work in partnership with the Veterans Crisis Line, so when you press one the call will be connected to a special center that's operated by Veterans Affairs,\" Shari Sinwelski, associate director for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, told BuzzFeed News. You can also reach the Veterans Crisis Line by sending a text message to 838255, or by clicking here to chat with a VA responder online. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Then, the call is routed to a local crisis center. Music will play. Wait times are usually under one minute, but they can be longer depending on the center's resources. Lifeline is actually made up of a network of 161 crisis centers across the country, Sinwelski said. Most crisis centers are non-profit and are staffed by both professionals and volunteers. When an individual calls in, they will be routed to the crisis center located closest to them. \"The reason why we do that is because we believe local crisis centers, ideally, are best able to help people in their own communities because the staff are aware of the resources in that community,\" Sinwelski said. There is also a backup network, so if your community doesn't have a crisis center or your crisis center is swamped with calls, you can still reach someone. According to Lifeline, they are able to answer 85% of calls within 30 seconds after the greeting, and 97% within 75 seconds or less. However, there are occasions where people have to wait to talk to a counselor. Wait times might vary depending on where the person is calling from, whether their local crisis center has enough resources and staff, and the volume of calls coming in. \"We've seen a big increase in ca...</td>\n",

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR An image of the U.S. Capitol being hit by an explosion has been posted on a North Korean propaganda website. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The video, published by the semi-official Uriminzokkiri agency and posted on its YouTube account, at first shows still images of North Korean artillery, missiles and soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It then moves on to film of numerous missiles being fired, before showing what appears to be a gun sight zeroing in on the White House and then the U.S. Capitol. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"The White House is caught in the panoramic sight of a (North Korean) long-range missile. This hotbed of war is in the scope of a nuclear bomb blow,\" a caption on the video says, according to a translation by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A video showing an American city that looked like New York engulfed in flames after a missile attack was posted on the same website last month. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Yonhap via EPA An image taken from a North Korean propaganda website Monday appears to show the U.S. Capitol -- wrongly identified as the White House -- being hit by a missile. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It was part of a dream sequence in which a photographer circles the earth in a fictional North Korea space shuttle. It was accompanied by an instrumental version of the song “We are the World.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"Black smoke is seen somewhere in America,\" text that accompanied the video said. \"It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire it started.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 'Petulant child' NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Tension has been high on the Korean Peninsula since the North carried out a rocket test in December and then a nuclear bomb test in February. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR It also took the opportunity to threaten South Korea with “final destruction” during a United Nations Conference on Disarmament last month. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR A propaganda video posted on YouTube by the North Korea government shows a missile launch and a city that appears to be New York, in flames. NBC's Brian Williams reports. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR And then on March 9, the North threatened to exercise its “right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack\" as new sanctions were unanimously agreed by the United Nations Security Council. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Heather Williams, a research fellow at the U.K.’s Chatham House website, said North Korea was “almost like a petulant child,” constantly wanting to remind people of its existence by acting out. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR She said images like the Capitol and New York explosions fitted the theme of previous propaganda from Pyongyang, but added “at the same time, it’s a more serious situation than we have seen in quite a while.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “It is a reminder of the situation and that things could escalate,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Williams said Kim Jong Un was a “young, new leader” who still needed to “prove himself” to the country’s powerful military. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “My take is that it is overwhelmingly bluster for domestic reasons, not international ones,” she said.

NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"These programs demonstrate North Korea's commitment to develop long-range missile technology that could pose a direct threat to the United States, and its efforts to produce and market ballistic missiles raise broader regional and global security concerns,\" Clapper told the Senate Intelligence committee.

       "99  A pilot climbs out of a British Typhoon jet fighter of the Royal Air Force's Number 3 Squadron, parked at Gioia del Colle air base near Bari, Southern Italy, as Italian army trucks stand nearby, Monday... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Coalition forces bombarded Libya for a third straight night Monday, targeting the air defenses and forces of Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, stopping his advances and handing some momentum back to the rebels, who were on the verge of defeat just last week. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR But the rebellion's more organized military units were still not ready, and the opposition disarray underscored U.S. warnings that a long stalemate could emerge. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The air campaign by U.S. and European militaries has unquestionably rearranged the map in Libya and rescued rebels from the immediate threat they faced only days ago of being crushed under a powerful advance by Gadhafi's forces. The first round of airstrikes smashed a column of regime tanks that had been moving on the rebel capital of Benghazi in the east. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Monday night, Libyan state TV said a new round of strikes had begun in the capital, Tripoli, marking the third night of bombardment. But while the airstrikes can stop Gadhafi's troops from attacking rebel cities _ in line with the U.N. mandate to protect civilians _ the United States, at least, appeared deeply reluctant to go beyond that toward actively helping the rebel cause to oust the Libyan leader. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama said Monday that \"it is U.S. policy that Gadhafi has to go.\" But, he said, the international air campaign has a more limited goal, to protect civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our military action is in support of an international mandate from the Security Council that specifically focuses on the humanitarian threat posed by Col. Gadhafi to his people. Not only was he carrying out murders of civilians but he threatened more,\" the president said on a visit to Chile. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington, the American general running the assault said there is no attempt to provide air cover for rebel operations. Gen. Carter Ham said Gadhafi might cling to power once the bombardment finishes, setting up a stalemate between his side and the rebels, with allied nations enforcing a no-fly zone to ensure he cannot attack civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR At the United Nations Monday, the Security Council turned down a request by Libya for an emergency session. Libya wanted \"an emergency meeting in order to halt this aggression.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Henri Guaino, a top adviser to the French president, said the allied effort would last \"a while yet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Among the rebels, as well, there was a realization that fighting could be drawn out. Mohammed Abdul-Mullah, a 38-year-old civil engineer from Benghazi who was fighting with the rebel force, said government troops stopped all resistance after the international campaign began. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR \"The balance has changed a lot,\" he said. \"But pro-Gadhafi forces are still strong. They are a professional military and they have good equipment. Ninety percent of us rebels are civilians, while Gadhafi's people are professional fighters.\" NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Disorganization among the rebels could also hamper their attempts to exploit the turn of events. Since the uprising began, the opposition has been made up of disparate groups even as it took control of the entire east of the country. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Regular citizens _ residents of the \"liberated\" areas _ took up arms and formed a ragtag, highly enthusiastic but highly undisciplined force that in the past weeks has charged ahead to fight Gadhafi forces, only to be beaten back by superior firepower. Regular army units that joined the rebellion have proven stronger, more organized fighters, but only a few units have joined the battles while many have stayed behind as officers struggle to get together often antiquated, limited equipment and form a coordinated force. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Discord also plagued the coalition. The U.S. was eager to pass leadership off, but the allies were deeply divided on the issue.

       "15  Taiwan has been governed separately from the mainland since 1949, when the American-supported Nationalist forces retreated to the island after being defeated in the Chinese civil war by the Communists. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Evan S. Medeiros, who until this year was the top official overseeing Asia at the National Security Council, said that the explicit threat of sanctions against companies differed from earlier sales, when the threat was more implicit. At the same time, Mr. Medeiros noted, earlier arms sales resulted in the suspension of meetings between the two militaries, which was not part of China’s initial response to the sale this time. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Medeiros, who now leads the Asia practice for the Eurasia Group in Washington, said that the timing of the sale, coming before next month’s presidential elections in Taiwan, helped to reduce the diplomatic fallout. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Video NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Taiwan’s president, Ma Ying-jeou, has sought to improve ties with mainland China and met last month in Singapore with President Xi Jinping of China, the first time the leaders of Taiwan and China had ever held a summit meeting. But Mr. Ma’s party, the Kuomintang, is expected to lose the presidency to the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors a more distant relationship with the mainland and the assertion of Taiwan’s own identity. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR “The timing clearly was calibrated to avoid having to do it after the election,” Mr. Medeiros said, speaking in a telephone interview from Taiwan, where he was meeting officials. “That would have been particularly provocative.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The sale is significantly smaller than the $5.8 billion package approved by the United States in 2011, and it is not expected to alter the military balance across the Taiwan Strait, which has tilted in Beijing’s favor after years of large increases in military spending by the mainland, whose annual military budget is now more than 13 times greater than Taiwan’s. Absent from the arms package is any assistance from the United States to help build diesel-electric submarines, a top priority for Taiwan, which wants to replace its aging fleet.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month and raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The Labor Department's monthly jobs report, the last major economic data before Tuesday's congressional elections, also showed that the unemployment rate remained at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The influx of new job-seekers in October increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years and are spending freely and propelling brisk economic growth. The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such period on record, and October marked the 100th straight month of hiring, a record streak. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The resulting strength in customer demand has led companies to steadily add workers. Though economists predict that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there's no sign of that happening yet. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the latest month of healthy job growth might not tip many votes in the midterm elections. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy's performance, that sentiment hasn't necessarily broadened support for President Donald Trump or Republican congressional candidates. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In October, consumer confidence reached its highest point in 18 years, propelled by optimism about the job market. Last month's plunge in stock prices didn't dampen Americans' enthusiasm, though the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the full market decline had occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR In the July-September quarter, consumer spending grew by the most in four years and helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That growth followed a 4.2 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter. Combined, the two quarters produced the strongest six-month stretch of growth in four years. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Manufacturing output and hiring remain healthy, according to a survey by a private trade association, although increased tariffs have raised factory costs. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR By contrast, housing remains a weak spot in the economy, with sales of existing homes having fallen for six straight months as mortgage rates have risen to nearly 5 percent. But slower sales have started to limit home price increases, which had been running at more than twice the pace of wage gains. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR There are signs that pay growth is picking up. A measure of wage and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the best such showing in a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Although pay increases can help boost spending and propel the economy's growth, they can also lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. That trend, in turn, can accelerate inflation. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR So far, though, inflation remains in check. The Federal Reserve's preferred price measure rose 2 percent in September compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the year-over-year increase in August. |||||\\n   \n",

A study from researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found that those who spent more time on social media were likelier to suffer from depression. The team surveyed 1,787 adults from 19 to 32 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Brian Primack, MD, Ph.D, and co-author of that study told Cosmpolitan.com there were many factors causing foul moods. FOMO, feeling inadequate compared to others’ “perfect” lives and wasting time browsing the timeline are just a few influences driving that spike in depression.

A recent survey by the Associated Press found that most teens, about 60 percent of respondents 13-17 years old, have taken a break from popular apps like Instagram and Snapchat.

       "57  The moment has arrived. Executives from Research in Motion have gathered for a six-city, simultaneous launch of BlackBerry 10, a mobile operating system that will power a new series of phones (and who knows what else). In one hour we’ll hear about the all-new BlackBerry 10 platfor, and two new phones, rumored to be called the Z10 and X10. Here in New York, hundreds of analysts, journalists and industry observers are bustling around the blue-tinted environs of Pier 36 in the Lower East Side for the launch which starts at 10am EST (7am Pacific). NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Some are skeptical about today’s launch. RIM’s global market share is down to roughly 6% from a peak of 20% just three years ago; its shares are down 80% in the same period. This is a story of how quickly even dominant players in the new world of telecoms can fall behind if they stall in development: take a breath and you’re king of the industry; let it out and someone’s just overtaken you. In RIM’s case, iPhones and Android phones became the devices everyone wanted for both work and play, crimping RIM’s marketshare after a peak in 2009. A trickier-than-expected transition from RIM’s purchase of QNX in 2010 didn’t help matters. QNX technology will now power BB10. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Today is widely seen as the company’s last shot at relevance, a cliched Hail Mary Pass. It has laid off thousands of employees to save $1 billion in costs, but today RIM is pulling out the stops with a big launch venue. Stay tuned… NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 9.37 am EST: The main hall has opened for press, with Hot Chip thumping through the speakers. And some nice news for RIM’s shares: they’re currently up 4.2% after a two-day decline. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 9.46am EST: The rest of the launch attendees are filling up the main hall – it’s getting loud and busy. Not long now. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:06 am EST: Our MC has taken to the stage and we’re starting with video link-ups with the five other launch events around the world: London, Dubai, Toronto Paris and Johannesburg. The crowd in Toronto looks especially excited. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:13 am EST: We’re seeing a couple of videos from industry and die-hard consumer fans of the BlackBerry. If you’re interested, you can watch them here. And here is a guy who has been growing his hair until the launch of BlackBerry 10 – a stage hand has just snipped off his pony tail in front of the cheering audience. That was cute. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:14 am EST: And now, RIM’s chief executive, Thorsten Heins has taken to the stage. Looking relaxed in a grey suit with no tie. It’s been almost one year exactly since I was handed the reins of Research in Motion and it has easily bee the most challenging year of my career to date… but also the most exhilarating and rewarding.” NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:20 am EST: Heins: “We will soon give you more ways to connect your mobile experience to the world around you… We will be a leader in connecting you to your Internet of Things.” This is what RIM means when they talk about BlackBerry 10 being for hyper-connected consumers. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:23 am EST: Heins says RIM had to make the tough decision to “go it alone” with its own software platform. He is publicly thanking RIM’s engineers and carrier partners. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10.27 am EST: Transitioning to RIM’s new phase it took heartfelt and brutal honesty with ourselves. We have transformed ourselves inside and out. Some big news: Research in Motion has rebranded itself as just BlackBerry. Now “Apple” isn’t the only fruit-theme tech moniker on the block. “ It all starts today with our renaming and our global launch of BlackBerry 10,” says Heins. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10.28 am EST: And here are the two new phones: the touchscreen Z10 and the Q10, a phone with a physical keyboard. The phones boast 1080p video recording. “Aren’t they beautiful?” asks Heins. (The rumors were almost right. Reports initially called them the Z10 and “X10″) NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:31 am EST: The devices have a “glass-weave” cover. Now Vivek Bhardwaj, head of BlackBerry’s software portfolio takes to the stage to demonstrate BlackBerry 10. The backdrop already refers to Bhardwaj’s employer as “BlackBerry.” He’s demonstrating BlackBerry Flow, and seamless transitions between apps like YouTube and the phone’s Hub. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 10:33 am EST: Bhardwaj demonstrates watching a movie on the phone – the famous red LED on all BlackBerry phone flashes to indicate an email. He swipes the film slightly to the right to “peek” into the Hub and see what the email is. “We’ve move from content, straight into BlackBerry Hub.” RIM’s big idea is that checking notifications should not be disruptive, but seamless. Swipe down slightly and you can peek into your calendar to see what appointments you have coming up. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR 1...   \n",
       "5   Suicide hotlines can provide free and confidential support 24/7. Here's what to expect when you make the call. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR [If you or someone you know is in immediate danger or having a medical emergency, call 911.] NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) is a toll-free hotline in the US for people in distress who feel like they are at risk of harming themselves. But what actually happens when you call? D3sign / Getty Images / Via gettyimages.com Suicide is complicated and sometimes hard to predict, but health experts say it can be preventable. That's why there are services like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and the hope is that people will use them if they, or someone they know, are having a crisis. But for many people, there is still some mystery about what actually happens during these calls, and some misconceptions can keep people from picking up the phone. So we put together a step-by-step guide about what to expect when you call a suicide hotline. Keep in mind, however, that everyone who calls into a suicide hotline may have a slightly different conversation and experience. And there are also hundreds of different suicide and crisis-prevention hotlines and chat services. For the purposes of this post, we will focus on the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and another line that you can text, called the Crisis Text Line. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR First, the basics: Lifeline provides free, confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for anyone of any age — including non-English speakers. Anyone can call the Lifeline, whether they are thinking about suicide or not, and get emotional support. There is no minimum age, and you can receive support at any time, even on holidays. As long as you have a phone, you can call the number and talk to someone. Lifeline is also available for non-English speakers and people who are deaf or hard of hearing. If you are a Spanish speaker, call the Spanish-language Lifeline at 1-888-628-9454. Si hablas español, llama a 1-888-628-9454. Lifeline ofrece 24/7, gratuito servicios en español. If you speak another language, call the main line and wait to be connected to a person at a local crisis center who can connect with a translator. According to Lifeline's website, the crisis centers work with a service that can translate calls in over 150 languages. People who are deaf or hard of hearing can reach Lifeline via TTY by dialing 1-800-799-4889 or use the Lifeline Live Chat service online. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR When you first call, you will get an automated greeting with additional options. A person does not come on the line immediately. After dialing 1-800-273-8255, you will hear the following automated message: \"You have reached the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, also servicing the Veterans service line. If you are in emotional distress or suicidal crisis or are concerned about someone who might be, we're here to help. Please remain on the line while we route your call to the nearest crisis center in our network.\" The automated message also provides additional options for Spanish speakers and veterans. If you speak Spanish, press two. If you are a veteran or an active duty member of the military or calling about someone who is, you can press one. \"We work in partnership with the Veterans Crisis Line, so when you press one the call will be connected to a special center that's operated by Veterans Affairs,\" Shari Sinwelski, associate director for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, told BuzzFeed News. You can also reach the Veterans Crisis Line by sending a text message to 838255, or by clicking here to chat with a VA responder online. NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR Then, the call is routed to a local crisis center. Music will play. Wait times are usually under one minute, but they can be longer depending on the center's resources. Lifeline is actually made up of a network of 161 crisis centers across the country, Sinwelski said. Most crisis centers are non-profit and are staffed by both professionals and volunteers. When an individual calls in, they will be routed to the crisis center located closest to them. \"The reason why we do that is because we believe local crisis centers, ideally, are best able to help people in their own communities because the staff are aware of the resources in that community,\" Sinwelski said. There is also a backup network, so if your community doesn't have a crisis center or your crisis center is swamped with calls, you can still reach someone. According to Lifeline, they are able to answer 85% of calls within 30 seconds after the greeting, and 97% within 75 seconds or less. However, there are occasions where people have to wait to talk to a counselor. Wait times might vary depending on where the person is calling from, whether their local crisis center has enough resources and staff, and the volume of calls coming in. \"We've seen a big increase in ca...   \n",

Now a quasi-official North Korean news agency has posted a new video—this one of the US Capitol exploding, NBC News reports. Intercut with images of North Korean artillery and missiles, the video also shows a target homing in on the White House. \"The White House is caught in the panoramic sight of a long-range missile,\" reads a caption. \"This hotbed of war is in the scope of a nuclear bomb blow.\" The video comes after months of alarming moves by Pyongyang. The North has tested a rocket and a nuclear weapon, threatened to nuke the US, and announced the end of the armistice that has kept peace on the Korean peninsula.

The campaign to destroy Moammar Gadhafi's air defenses and establish a no-fly zone is almost complete, and American officials are seeking to hand over leadership of the operation to European allies, reports the New York Times. \"My sense is that unless something unusual or unexpected happens, we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks, \" said Gen. Carter Ham. Coalition forces aren't attempting to provide air cover for rebels, he added, warning of a potentially long stalemate between Gadhafi's forces and the rebels, AP reports. President Obama says that he expects control of the operation to be handed over within days. \"It is US policy that Gadhafi needs to go,” he told reporters. “And we’ve got a wide range of tools in addition to our military effort to support that policy.\"\\n   \n",

The Obama administration announced a $1.8 billion arms package sale to Congress on Wednesday, Reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and $416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies. The announcement came amid reports that the US had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from China, which still claims Taiwan as a territory, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters. China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and \"severely\" damages China's sovereignty. \"China's government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies,\" a ministry spokesman says. A Pentagon spokesman gave the equivalent of an eyeroll Wednesday, per the New York Times, noting, \"The Chinese can react to this as they see fit. … It's a [clear-eyed], sober view of an assessment of Taiwan's defense needs. … There's no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with China.\" Meanwhile, the AP notes that China has issued similar threats before, with \"no evidence they've had any meaningful effect.\" (All this despite a lengthy handshake last month.)\\n   \n",

What's more, wages rose 3.1% when compared to last October, the best such gain since 2009. It's the first time since the recession ended that wages rose more than 3% over a year.

Reg Foggerdy had been last seen near a campsite on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia while on a hunting trip with his brother, reports the Guardian. He had left to shoot a feral camel but never returned, adds the BBC. Though an experienced bushman, he was wearing only a T-shirt, shorts, hat, and flip-flops and had no food or water, police say. Police began a land and air search after discovering a camel carcass and finally discovered fresh tracks on Monday, reports the West Australian. Foggerdy was found \"extremely dehydrated, a bit delusional,\" under a tree Tuesday morning about 9 miles from his last known location. \"He's received treatment, first aid on the ground, and it's fair to say he's now sitting up and talking,\" officer Andy Greatwood tells ABC Radio, adding Foggerdy's \"fantastic survival skills\" kept him alive when \"most people would not have survived.\" After walking for miles, Foggerdy had spent his last two days in the Outback \"lying down under a tree and eating black ants,\" Greatwood says. Foggerdy's wife, Erlyn, says he may have picked up that tip from a jungle survival show he liked to watch every day, reports PerthNow. Foggerdy's 11-year-old son says he initially wasn't too concerned when his father didn't return to camp, but \"when he was lost for a few more days I started getting worried. I'm so happy they found him.\" Family members add they'll now force Foggerdy, who's recovering in a hospital, to carry a satellite phone. (A dad's survival tip kept this lost boy alive.)\\n   \n",

Finally, officers skillfully plucked the gun right out of Brock Ray Bunge's hideout—without putting their lives in danger. \"The robot was a game changer,\" Capt. Jack Ewell tells the Los Angeles Times of the department's $300,000 Andros robot that did the deed; it's typically used to defuse bombs but is becoming increasingly useful in other cases. Officers say they were using the device to learn more about Bunge's position when they noticed Bunge was lying on his stomach with his weapon at his feet. While officers distracted Bunge, the robot grabbed the gun \"without him noticing,\" says Ewell. The robot then went back to remove the fencing, and Bunge surrendered as soon as he realized his gun was missing, police add; he has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted murder and robbery. Though the robot that nicked the gun is expensive, \"when it saves lives, it is more than worth it,\" Ewell says. Officers also used a robot during the Dallas shooting.

The results of an AP poll released last week show that nearly 60% of teens in the US have taken social media breaks—most of the time voluntary ones that last at least a week. Now researchers at the University of South Wales have presented findings to the British Psychological Society that suggest even what are perceived to be straightforward perks of social media—such as getting attention via likes—may not exactly elevate the end user's mood. \"Although this is just a relatively small-scale study, the results indicate that the ways we interact with social media can affect how we feel, and not always positively,\" one researcher says. To test this, the team reports in a Science Daily news release that it recruited 340 participants on Twitter and Facebook to complete personality questionnaires and then agree or disagree with 25 statements. Key findings include that people who go out of their way to rack up more likes tend to have low self-esteem and be less trusting of others, and that those likes don't actually lift their mood or how they see themselves. Previous research has looked not at more likes, but at more time, reports Medical Daily. It cites a study published in 2016 that surveyed 19- to 32-year-olds and found \"individuals in the highest quartile of [social media] site visits per week ... had significantly increased odds of depression.\" (Young people average at least an hour a day on social media.)\\n   \n",
       "57  – The six-city launch of the new BlackBerry 10 phones and operating system is now complete. One of the biggest shockers from the event: Research in Motion is scrapping its name, and will now be known simply as BlackBerry. Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the \"heartfelt and brutal honesty\" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes. It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the Q10 was created for customers \"that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience,\" reports USA Today. The company also added some star power, announcing that Alicia Keys would be its new Global Creative director, a position created for her, the Verge reports. The company also boasted that Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project. On to the features. First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft's latest Windows iteration. BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry's dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile. As for hardware, BlackBerry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier. The phones will be available tomorrow in the UK, but the US will have to cool its heel until March.\\n   \n",
